There are multiple folders, numbered to keep them sorted. Each of the folders deals with a certain aspect of machine learning. Each contains a main.py file that contains the python code.

In order to execute the code online, follow these steps:

Go to Repl.it
login with your credentials or via Github
Go to my repls
Create a new repls for Python
Each repls will represent one folder of this project
Once a repls is created, main.py will already be created for you
Copy code from the current folder's main.py into the repls main.py
Add a new file and copy the csv file's content

Now click on run in the repls. The code should run fine
